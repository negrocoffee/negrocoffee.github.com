#### Sell your colleagues on Value Proposition Design

I am...

* concerned that we don´t have a methodology to track our progress on the development of that new value proposition and business model.
* worried that we focues too much on products and features instead of creating value for customers.
* astonished at how poorly aligned product development, sales, and marketing are when it comes to developing new value propositions.
* surprised at how often we make stuff nobody wants, despite our good ideas and good intentions.
* really disappointed by how much we talked about value proposition and business models at our last meeting without really getting tangible results.
* blowns away by how unclear that last presentation on that new value proposition and business model was.
* amazed by how mane resources we wasted when that great idea in that last business plan turned out ot be flop because we didn´t test it.

## Canvas

The *Value Proposition Canvas* has two sides. With the *Customer Profile* you clarify your customer understanding. With the *Value Map* you describe how you intend to create value for that customer. You achieve Fit between the two when one meets the other.

#### Create Value

The set of value proposition benefits that you design to attract customers.

##### Observe Customers

The set of customer characteristics that you assume, observe, and verify in the market.

**Def-i-ni-tion**

##### Value Proposition

Describes the benefits customers can expect from your products and services.

##### Value Map

Describes the features of a specific value proposition in your business model in a more structured and detailed way. It breaks your value proposition down into **products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators**.

**Gain Creators** describe how your products and services create customer gains.

**Pain relievers** describe how your products and services alleviate customer pains.

##### Customer Profile

describes a specific customer segment in your business model in a more structured and detailed way. It breaks the customer down into its jobs, pains, and gains.

You achieve **Fit** when your value map meets your customer profile —when your products and services produce pain relievers and gain creators that match one or more of the jobs, pains, and gains that are important to your customer.

**Gains** describe the outcomes customers want to achieve or the concrete benefits they are seeking.

**Pains** describe bed outcomes, risks, and obstacles related to customer jobs.

**Customer jobs** describe what customers are trying to get done in their work and in their lives, as expressed in their own words.

#### Customer Profile

##### Customer Jobs

Could be the tasks they are trying to perform and complete, the problems they are trying to solve, or the needs they are trying to satisfy. Make sure you take the customers perspective when investigating jobs. Distinguish between three:

###### Functional jobs

Performing or completing a specific task or solve a specific problem. 

###### Social jobs

Looking good or gaining power or status. These jobs describe how customers want to be perceived by others.

###### Personal/emotional jobs

Seeking a specific emotional state.

###### Supporting jobs

Purchasing or consuming value either as consumers or as professionals. arise from three different roles:

* **Buyer of value**: jobs related to buying value, such as comparing offers, deciding which products to buy, etc.
* **Cocreator of value**: 
* **Transferrer of value**

###### Job context

The context may impose certain constraints or imitations. 

##### Job importance

According to the customers, some jobs are more important than others.

#### Customer Pains

Pains describe anything that annoys your customers before, during, and after trying to get a job done or simply prevents them from getting a job done. also describe risks or potential bad outcomes. 

##### Undesired outcomes, problems, and characteristics 

Pains are functional, social, emotional or ancillary.

##### Obstacles

Preventing or slowing down the customer from getting a job done. 

##### Risks

#### Pain severity

level of pain, like the importance of the job.
