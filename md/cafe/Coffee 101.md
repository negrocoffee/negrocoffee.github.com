# Coffee 101

## Lesson 1

In this first lesson, we will explore where coffee comes from and
where it grows.
The English term coffee evolved from the Arabic word qahwah, which
was translated into Turkish as kahve and then as café in French,
caffe in Italian, koffie in Dutch and kaffee in German.
Coffee grows on trees that flower and produce fleshy red fruit
called a drupe though it is popularly referred to as the 'berry' or
'cherry'. What we refer to as coffee beans are actually seeds,
which are produced in the centre of the drupe, often in pairs.
After harvesting, the flesh of the drupe is washed or dried and the
'beans' extracted.
The two major species of coffee are Coffea Arabica and Coffea
Canephora (Robusta Coffee). Robusta contains around double the
amount of caffeine found in Arabica, and as its name infers, is
easier to care for.
It is synonymous with the production of lower grade coffee blends
where it is typically used as a filler. It is also included in
'instant' coffee and in espresso blends to enhance the formation of
'crema', the silky froth that forms on top of a well extracted
espresso.
Arabica is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been
cultivated. It requires more care during cultivation and is
considered to produce better coffee than Robusta. Arabica plants
grow at high altitudes of around 1000 to 2000 metres,
approximately 3200 to 6500 ft, above sea level.
Arabica is the species most associated with speciality (sometimes
referred to as gourmet) coffees.
The only place where Arabica coffee grows indigenously is Ethiopia.
It is the birth place of coffee and also the only place in which it
truly grows wild. All countries that produce Arabica coffees have
transplanted plant stock directly from Ethiopia or from other
countries that have previously done so.
Even though hybrid varieties of Arabica have since been produced
with a view to making them resistant to pests and higher yielding,
the history of every plant can in some way be traced back to
Ethiopia.
The history of coffee is patchy and full of myth and hearsay. For
instance there is the tale of Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder who
is said to have discovered coffee.
The story goes that he saw his goats eating coffee 'berries' and
as a result becoming elated. So, Kaldi then tried them himself and
thus the potential of coffee was discovered.
It is far more likely that uses for coffee were developed over
time and were discovered by people tasting various parts of the
'cherry', nevertheless, the old fables do add a bit of romance and
are very cute.
Coffee requires a warm climate and lots of moisture, so it is
produced within a belt extending around the world between the
Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Although there are
now many countries producing coffee, most good quality beans are
grown in Latin America, eastern Africa, and Asia.
\>From its humble beginnings in Ethiopia, coffee has evolved to
become the second most traded commodity in the world after oil.

will expand on some of the information contained in lesson one and

will expand on some of the information contained in lesson one and
explore the rise of coffee in popular western culture.

## Lesson 2

Welcome to the second instalment of coffee101. Yesterday we looked briefly at where coffee comes from and where it grows. Today we are going to explore a little more history of coffee and how it became the popular beverage we know today.There are many incomplete and occasionally contradictory records of how coffee became popular and spread around the world. No-one can be certain of all of the facts, but nevertheless it is still fun to explore.It is thought that some form of coffee cultivation may have started as early as A.D. 575, though written references to it did not begin until much later, with one of the earliest recorded being around the 10th Century by the famous Persian physician and alchemist, Rhazes.However, it would be another four to five hundred years before coffee really rose to popular acclaim, and having been traded through the port of Mocha (in present day Sudan), we know that by the 15th Century it was actively being cultivated in Yemen.The early origins of coffee in the west had quite deep religious links. For some it played an important ceremonial role, whilst others considered it to be an evil concoction and wanted it to be made illegal.There is a story that suggests advisors asked Pope Clement VIII to outlaw coffee as it was a favourite beverage of the infidel Ottoman Empire that they considered such a threat. After consideration, the Pope is said to have had a cup of this "evil elixir" prepared for him and declared it "delicious". So he baptised the brew, making it immediately acceptable and instantly popular in Christian Europe.Coffee reached the masses of Europe in 1615. It was introduced by Venetian traders and initially sold by lemonade vendors, some of whom promoted it as having medicinal qualities. The first of the famous European coffee houses are not believed to have opened until the middle of the 17th Century.The popularity of coffee spread through Europe during the 17th and 18th Centuries. For example, from not long after their inception around 1650 and for the remainder of the period, more coffee shops existed in London than do so today.Coffee shops were influential places, used extensively by artists, intellectuals, merchants and bankers. Coffee houses became a forum for political activity and a place where business was done. For instance the great Lloyds of London insurance company began life in a small London café, and flourished into the institution we know today.In 1616, realising the commercial advantages of cultivating the plant required to produce this brand new drink, Dutch sea captain Pieter Van der Broeck, ignoring a strict Arabian policy not to export fertile beans in order that coffee could not be cultivated anywhere else, stole a dozen plants from Mocha and returned home with them to the Netherlands, where they were cultivated in greenhouses.Those plants gave birth to plantations in the Dutch colonies in Java (now part of Indonesia), Timor, Sumatra, Ceylon and Celebes. The French and Spanish soon followed the trend with plantations in their respective colonies. Despite its enormous empire, the UK didn't follow suit until 1730 when it began production in Jamaica. It was 1840 before the UK began to grow coffee in India, where historically it had always cultivated tea.The story of how coffee reached the new world of the Americas is another that is shrouded in uncertainty and conjecture. Gabriel Mathieu de Clieu was a young French naval officer serving in Martinique, who in 1720 whilst on leave, frequented a number of Paris coffee houses and became passionate about the beverage.It is said he developed a fascination with the idea of growing coffee in the new world and somehow managed to acquire a coffee tree seedling, probably from the botanical gardens where the Dutch had gifted a number of plants to the French. The seedling went with him when he set sail back to Martinique.Whilst on the voyage the plant was a point of interest for many passengers, some of whom actually tried to destroy it.The voyage itself was also not without problems which resulted in the rationing of drinking water. With the bare minimum needed to survive, Gabriel shared his scant allowance with the seedling and both survived.The plant that grew was to become the father of all the coffee in the Americas and Caribbean. Unfortunately, the story ends on a sad note. Gabriel Mathieu de Clieu, the man who introduced coffee to Latin America, died a poor and destitute man in Paris during the French revolution.Coffee slowly spread south through Suriname and French Guyana, from where it was introduced to Brazil by Portuguese military man, Francisco de Melo Palheta. One account suggests that he smuggled the seeds to Brazil in the heads of flowers given to him by the wife of the Governor of Guyana, Mme d'Orvilliers.By the early 19th Century, coffee had thoroughly established its importance to the economies of many Central and South American nations.Coffee once again experienced an upturn in popularity by the late 20th and early 21st Centuries. Large coffee house chains established an international footprint, introducing a multitude of coffee based drinks to the population at large.Speciality coffee became popular in many countries as committed individuals sought to offer the world's finest blends and single origin coffees to discerning customers.Many specialist coffee bars and bean roasters have sprung up in UK cities. In the USA, the boom is in full swing with numerous small roasteries and independent retailers joining in the revolution. The New Zealand and Australian speciality market is well established, and mainland Europe is gaining pace.In fact, coffee consumption in the whole world is on the up, and despite our history of tea drinking, particularly so here in the UK. With ever improving knowledge, education and most importantly quality, gourmet coffee is here to stay.So now we know where coffee comes from and a little about its  history. Our next instalment tomorrow will be about how coffee is processed and the different methods used.

## Lesson 3

Wow, day three already! Hopefully the first two lessons provided areasonable grounding for today, as we focus on the way coffee isprocessed at the countries of origin, and what the differentprocessing methods mean.Lesson one touched briefly on how coffee grows. To recap, thecoffee tree produces fleshy red fruit called a drupe, which iscommonly referred to as the 'berry' or 'cherry'. The coffee 'bean'is actually a seed which is encased within the cherry.Raw coffee beans are light brown in colour with a distinct greenhue which varies in depth. Consequently, unroasted beans areusually referred to as 'greens'.Speciality coffee picking tends to be undertaken by hand and goodquality harvesting takes place when the cherry is at its ripest.This can mean many re-picks as only fruit that is fully ripe isselected in order to get the very best cup of coffee possible. Incontrast, lesser quality commercial grade commodity coffees areoften strip picked, having everything taken from the plant at oncefor reasons of speed and labour economy. This can have asignificant effect on the cup quality.After the ripe fruit is harvested, the beans need to be removedfrom the cherry fruit and mucilage, then 'hulled', cleaned andsorted. This can be achieved in a number of ways.Wet processThe fruit of the cherry is removed from the beans before they aredried. This is referred to either as the washed process or the wetprocess, and the resulting production is known as washed coffee.The wet method lends itself to the efficient sorting and removal ofpoor quality beans. After harvest, the fruit is immersed in waterand sorted. Whilst good ripe coffee sinks to the bottom of thetank, bad or unripe fruit, the 'floaters and stinkers' as they arecalled, rise to the top and can be removed.The whole cherry is then pushed in water through a milling screenthat removes the flesh from the seed of the fruit, but this doesnot completely get rid of the slimy layer of mucilage, some ofwhich remains on the beans.The mucilage can be removed either by fermenting the beans in tanksbefore washing them in plenty of fresh water to remove any residue,or by the use of machinery employing a process of mechanicalscrubbing.The fermentation process is a very difficult thing to get right; ifleft too long the beans could have a nasty ferment taste to them,or not long enough and too much of the mucilage might remain on thebean, which would have an equally negative impact on the coffee.Conversely, fermentation that is carried out correctly can havesome very positive effects on the quality of the resulting coffeeby virtue of the process itself.Mechanical scrubbing has a far more predictable end result, thoughremoving the fermentation stage and prematurely separating thefruit residue from the bean does take away a valuable way ofinfluencing flavour in the cup.Once separated from the rest of the fruit and washed, the beansneed to be dried out to a water content of about 10% to achievestability. To achieve this, they are laid out to dry in the sun onpatios or drying tables until they contain around 12-13% moisture,and typically then brought down to around 10% by machine. The wholeprocess can be carried out in the machine but this generally onlyhappens when there are space or humidity issues.Once dried the coffee is in the parchment stage with a thin paperlike outer skin on the bean which can be easily removed by 'hulling'.Dry ProcessThe dry process is the oldest way of processing beans and is themost commonly used method in Asia and Ethiopia. It is sometimesalso referred to as the natural process.After harvest, the entire cherries are cleaned and sorted to removeunripe, over-ripe or damaged fruit, before being allowed to drywhole in the sun on patios or drying tables. It can take up to 6weeks for the cherries to dry. There is a significant risk of moulddeveloping, so the cherries have to be turned regularly. Rain isanother potential issue as the whole crop could be ruined ifsubjected to a downpour.Once dry, the complete cherry is hulled to remove the entire driedouter fruit covering all at once.Pulped NaturalThis is a mixture of the wet and dry processes. It is very popularin Brazil and is also being tried in many other countries as well.The cherry is passed through a milling screen to remove the skinand some of the pulp like in the wet process, but fermentation ormachine scrubbing does not follow. Instead, the resulting bean isthen dried in the sun retaining many of the sugars of the cherryand creating a very interesting coffee.Hulling and GradingThe parchment that is left coating the beans after they have beenprocessed using any of the three methods is then removed or'hulled' mechanically by a process ranging from gentle whacking bya bespoke machine to the use of a very basic millstone.The coffee is then sorted to remove defective beans, graded forsize and quality, bagged and prepared for shipping in its greenunroasted state.Our next instalment will be all about coffee roasting. Despitebeing shrouded in mystery for many years, it is not quite the darkart that some roasters would like to have us believe it is!

## Lesson 4

In this fourth session of Coffee101, I'm going to tell you how weat Has Bean roast coffee.Firstly, we should look at what a coffee roaster is, what it doesand how it can be used to get the very best out of coffee. For thepurpose of this lesson were going to explore the two main methodsof coffee roasting.Hot Air RoastingHot air roasting, also often referred to as fluidised bed roasting,involves the application of hot air to the beans on a fluid bedsystem. Air is normally heated by an electric element, whilst thenecessary air flow is produced by a fan. The fluid air keeps thebeans moving and thus negates any risk of scorching.There have been opinions expressed, which I tend to lean towards,that sometimes coffee can appear a little brighter than it mighthave been had radiant heat roasting been used. Brighter in coffeeterms means more lively with any acidity accentuated. The acidityreferred to is not typically the bad sour type that immediatelycomes to mind for most people.This is good acidity, perhaps citric based or floral, and itoffers a little extra flavour and perhaps a slight kick incontrast to the smooth tones often found in coffees. The issue isjust how prominent that acidity should ideally be.Hot air roasting can prove difficult when controlling the roastingprofile for professional use (profiles are explained in Lesson 5),though some roasters swear by it, so it is a case of using whateverbest suits individual needs. The fluid bed method is successfullyemployed in some home roasters and it is very well suited to thesesmaller machines.Drum Radiant Heat RoastingDrum roasters work like a large washing machine drum, turning thecoffee beans with a heat source below. I have found that gas(either propane or natural) is better than electricity. By better,I mean the flavour of the coffee differs when tasted in the cup andI prefer coffee roasted using gas.Roasting time is typically anywhere from 11 minutes to around 19minutes, and temperatures can reach as high as 450°F. Anythinglonger than 20 minutes and I beginto discern a baked taste withinthe coffee.When it has finished roasting, the coffee is then 'dropped' out ofthe roaster drum and cooled in a large integral tray with stirrers.Good quality roasters achieve cooling using air, though somelarger machines use water, which for me is not good for the coffeebean.What Happens To The Beans During The Roast Process?For the first few minutes the beans are 'endothermic', taking inheat. They remain greenish, before slowly turning a lighteryellowish colour and giving off a slightly grassy smell.The beans then begin to steam as their moisture content dissipatesand the steam becomes fragrant. Soon afterwards the 'first crack'can be heard, as the beans expand and crack when the real roastingprocess begins and the beans become 'exothermic', giving off heat.Sugars begin to caramelise, the structure of the beans breaks downand oils within them begin to rise to the surface.After first crack the beans once again become endothermic, and thecoffee is actually consumable depending on taste preference and theparticular type of bean.If left to roast further, caramelisation continues and oils becomemore evident on the surface of the beans. 'Second crack' thenoccurs as the beans once again become exothermic.Most roasts will have been terminated somewhere between the twocracks or shortly after the second. If left longer the roast willbecome very dark, smoke increases and natural sugars disappear,taking some of the potential sweetness from the cup. If charcoalappears, the roast has definitely gone too far.So, that is a little about the basics of roasting. The next lessonis about roast styles and what they mean.Relax and enjoy your cup!

## Lesson 5

The aim of the lesson today is to offer an understanding of variousroast styles that we use at Has Bean and some of the beansassociated with each one.The content is bound to be quite subjective towards the way we dothings, and of course, other roasters may have differing opinions.Nevertheless, I hope that you will find the overview interestingand helpful.For me the job of the person roasting is to help the beans fulfiltheir potential and become all that they can be without there beingany of the person's own signature left behind.For instance, the profile of a fine Kenyan is a delicate mixtureof fruit and red wine flavours. Dark roasting will eliminate manyof those flavours whilst allowing features of the roast itself todominate the beans in the final cup.Conversely, a dense Celebes, Kalosi or Sumatran will taste ofnothing but under-ripe fruit if taken light, but into secondcrack, the deep, earthy, spicy flavours will come to the forefront.The following are some of the roasting style descriptions that weuse here at Has Bean:Into First Crack (Light Roast)A light brown to cinnamon colour with low body and light acidity.The beans are dry at this stage. This roast restricts thedevelopment of the coffee and does not allow it to reach its fullpotential. Some moisture has been released, but the all importantcoffee oils have yet to fully develop. The beans are in the veryearly stages of being exothermic (creating heat by expansion).End of First Crack (Light Medium Roast)Medium light brown in colour. The acidity has brightened and bodyhas increased. At this stage the beans are releasing oils andbecoming much more like coffee as we all know and recognise it.This roast is useful for many 'delicate' beans. Light medium isalso a suitable cupping roast.Cupping is a method of sampling that roasters and coffeeprofessionals use to evaluate beans. In brief, the process involvesdeeply inhaling aromas from specially brewed bowls of coffee, thenslurping from them using a cupping spoon so that the tongue iscovered and oxygen is present, which  allows the flavours to fullydevelop and be experienced.In-between First and Second Crack (Medium Roast)Medium brown in colour. The acidity continues to increase and thebody becomes more noticeable. At this stage the bean is mostly dry.A popular roast for 'delicate' beans, suitable for many filter typeblends/origins and one of my favourite roasts. The beans are stillexothermic and their structure is on the verge of expanding furtheras the coffee oils heat up. Second crack is on its way.Start of Second Crack (Medium Dark Roast)A rich brown colour. Very small droplets of oil appear on the beansurface. The acidity has slowly diminished and body is at its best.Second crack has begun and the structure of the bean is starting tobreak down. From now on there is a balancing act to perform inorder to retain the integrity of the bean as the primary flavourprovider and the roast as secondary.This is the perfect roast for espresso blends and my favourite forthat purpose. It can be compared to a Northern Italian espressoroast as favoured by many professional espresso blenders, thoughin our new easy world of descriptions, we will call it a mediumdark roast.Well into Second Crack (Dark Roast)The term, 'well into second crack' refers, in this case, toanything from 20 seconds onwards. The bean is a deep brownish/blackshiny colour. It has spots of oil showing or is completely oily.Delicate flavours are lost and the taste of roasting begins toincrease, whilst aromas begin to diminish. This roast can givecertain beans real body when used correctly.Fully into Second Crack (Exceptionally Dark)The beans are black and covered with oils. All subtleties offlavour are gone, and the aromas are further reduced. This roast ischaracteristic of Southern Italy and of American espresso roasts.The roast itself has by now become the primary taste, and allcharacteristics of the bean have been completely demolished. Thereare very few beans that stand up well to this kind of roast and itshould be used with extreme care.So that is a little overview of roasting the Has Bean way. We arenow half-way through our ten day crash course in coffee basics.During the next lesson we are going to have a look at whatspeciality coffee actually is, and in what is probably the mostimportant part of the course, show you how to select a coffee thatis to your liking.Brew it freshly!

## Lesson 6

Speciality coffees differ from one another for a variety ofreasons, including the way in which they are cultivated, the areawhere they are grown, the altitude, the soil and even the way inwhich the farmer cares for his crop; for instance, if he growsorganically or not.Just like fine wines, speciality coffees vary according to countryand region of origin, and even from year to year. The way theroaster treats the coffee  also has a big impact on the final taste.We looked at Arabica and Robusta, the two major species of coffeein lesson one. It is now time to consider them specifically in thecontext of their place within the world of speciality coffee and todelve further into the varieties, grades, individualcharacteristics and naming of beans as we seek to select the rightcoffees for us.ArabicaArabica beans are the most sought after in the speciality marketand are utilised in blends or available as single origin coffees.They receive special care and attention throughout the process ofgrowing, milling and roasting. Arabica coffee usually grows at highaltitudes of above 1000 metres (3200 ft). This type of beanprovides us with the best tasting coffee.RobustaRobusta is a poorer quality, less expensive variety of coffee beangrown at altitudes below 1000 metres (3200 ft). It is traditionallyassociated with the production of cheaper blends, and is often usedto 'cut' a blend containing Arabica. Drunk on its own, Robustatastes poor, with a slight flavour of rubber. However, we shouldnot dismiss Robusta entirely out of hand as many roasters use it toperk up a blend. Indeed for the masters of the espresso, theItalians, this is a very common practice and used correctly it canadd to crema production (crema is the silky froth on top on anespresso) and indeed to the taste. Unfortunately, if usedincorrectly, it can ruin a good coffee and spoil the taste in thecup.VarietalsWe know that Arabica and Robusta are both species of coffee, butthat is not all. Within those species exist varietals. Knowing thevarietal of a coffee also offers vital clues as to how it maytaste. Some examples of Arabica varietals are Bourbon, Catucai,Catucaiaçu, Caturra and Pacamara. There are many more. Going into alot of detail about something as complex as coffee varietals isbeyond the scope of a basic overview of coffee, though it may besomething that I will return to and cover in more depth at a laterdate. For now, the important thing is simply to remember thevarietals that have attributes you enjoy most and the things thatdrive you away from other varietals.Something DifferentThere are also maragogype and peaberry coffees. Maragogype isactually a varietal, though it is simply identified by most peopleas being the 'giant bean' that is much larger in size than normalgrade coffee. Peaberries, smaller and rounder than typical beans,are simply the product of coffee cherries that have yielded onerather than two seeds. This phenomenon occurs in about ten percentof all cherries as the two seeds fail to form properly, growth isstunted and they meld together into one smaller seed. It is acommonly held view that both maragogype and peaberry beans canoften produce a more flavoursome, better tasting brew.What is in a Name?Now that we have looked at the species of beans, it is time toconsider the way coffees are named. The trend of late, particularlyin the speciality world, is to name a coffee after the farm orregion of origin. For example, a coffee will not just be sold,let's say, as 'Kenya AA' (where AA is simply the grade of thebean), but it will be named after the farm it came from, or aftersomething particular to the region where it was grown. This is veryrelevant as we have already noted that the region of origin, soiland altitude are important to the final taste, so naming the farmallows us to trace the history of the bean. The name can also giveconsumers information about the variety of coffee and even aninsight to the processes that the coffee has been subjected toduring milling.Time to Read the Cupping NotesDon't be afraid to try new coffees! On the Has Bean website we havefull sets of cupping notes on all the coffees we offer. These offera great insight into what flavours and attributes might be found inthe coffee.http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=GdWHk&m=1jubvDL7zwEU2i&b=b30vcPpTkJE6bPi_PqoxBwUse the 'Has Bean Steve' Coffee AssistantNot sure which coffee to choose?

However by buying from a quality supplier likeHas Bean and taking the right advice from the many reputablesources available via the internet, you can enjoy a very rewardingjourney around the continents, experiencing the many and variedtastes that speciality coffee has to offer.Next time, I am going to tell you how to brew superb coffee forvery little money and in a really easy way. No £1000 espressomachines or commercial grade equipment required!Quality tastes!

## Lesson 7

Do you want to know a big secret about brewing great coffee? Youdon't have to spend loads of money, it can be done with real easeand on a tight budget.One of my favourite ways to brew coffee is also one of the cheapestand easiest. In this session I'm going to explain step by step howto use a cafetiere (French press) and get the most out of it.This may sound like a very strange thing to discuss. Surely theFrench press is one of the easiest methods of brewing coffee? Itcan be, but attention to detail is everything and sometimes thingscan be missed.Get French press brewing right and it can be hugely rewarding. Addto this the relatively low cost that a French press can be pickedup for, and you've got a great way to enjoy your coffee.To start with, I will assume that your French press has beencleaned, you have a clear work top area and all of the followingthings are to hand:1. A kettle filled with fresh water2. A French press3. Coffee beans4. A coffee bean grinder5. A tea towel (or drying cloth)6. A mug or cup7. A stirring stick or spoon8. \*Optional* a thermal flask.Boil the water in the kettle. Once boiled, poor around 5cm of waterinto the French press. Gently swill the water around the jug makingsure that the whole jug is warmed.Then add the filter (plunger) to the jug and allow the heat to adda little expansion to the outer spring but only for a few moments.This will help in forming a secure seal when placed in the coffee.Throw the water away then dry the inside of the pot and the filtermechanism.Take your coffee beans and grind the amount you need. The grindshould be coarse and similar to sharp building sand. What do youmean you have never tried that in coffee!Below is a table of recommended amounts. Please note these are justa starting place, coffee is very personal and you may want tochange the quantities in order to get the brew just right for yourown taste.Cup Size                Level Table Spoons of Ground Coffee  3                     2.5  4                     3  8                     6  12                    9If you prefer to drink your coffee from a mug, a good rule of thumbis two cups are about equal to one mug.The water should be just off boiling (95ºC) when poured into thejug leaving around 2cm at the top of the pot to allow for thefilter part. Then take the stirring stick (or spoon) and stir thepot making sure all the grinds at bottom are nicely infused.Put the top of the pot back in place, so as to keep the springwarm, but do not press it down. Leave the coffee to brew for aroundfour minutes.Once four minutes has passed press down the plunger being carefulnot to exert too much pressure. You will get the best results ifyou are slow and gentle at this point.Forcing the filter can make hot coffee squirt out of the topresulting in it being wasted whilst possibly scalding you. If thereis undue pressure from the plunger it may be that you have groundthe coffee too fine. If this occurs, remove the filter, stir theliquid, and replace the filter again, remembering that next time acourser grind may be needed.Once infusion has finished pour the contents of the jug into cupsto be enjoyed immediately, or into a vacuum flask if you don't wantit to get cold too quickly. Leaving coffee in the pot with thegrinds can over extract the brew, leaving a bitter and unpleasantcup. Coffee should never be re-heated!So how easy was that? Cheap and very very tasty coffee! What morecan you ask for?These lessons are all about information and little secrets thatwill enhance your enjoyment of coffee. Next time, I will give youthe three most important tips about good coffee.Press and chill!

## Lesson 8

In today's lesson, I am going to tell you the big secret about howto get the very best out of coffee.It is 'Fresh', 'Fresh' and 'Fresh'!It so easy. Just follow these three steps and great coffee can beyours:Number One Fresh: Fresh coffee!Have you ever heard the saying that you cannot make a silk purseout of a sows ear? Well, you can't make good coffee from beans thatare stale, it just wont work.It needs to be freshly roasted. A good roaster will give you aroasted on date, and if they don't then you ask them when thecoffee was roasted.Number Two Fresh: Freshly Ground!If at all possible do not buy pre-ground coffee. The grindingprocess releases many of the aromatics in coffee and these are soonlost if the grinds are not used straight away. Additionally, agreater surface area of the bean is exposed to oxygen as it isground and this increases the speed at which the coffee stales,making the cup inferior if the grinds are stored. Having a goodgrinder is the one certain way to improve your enjoyment of coffee.Number Three Fresh: Fresh Water!Water makes up over 98% of the final cup. It is imperative that youuse fresh, if possible filtered, water. The better the quality ofthe water used, the better the quality of the final cup will be too.So there we are, the lesson today was very simple and extremelyimportant: Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!  Tomorrow, we will look atpotential reasons for and against roasting your own coffee.Keep it fresh!

## Lesson9 

Today's lesson is all about home roasting; the benefits andpotential pitfalls of roasting your own coffee.Home roasting has become increasingly popular in recent years withthe release of the 'Behmor' 'Hottop', 'Cafe Gene', 'I-Roast' and'I-Roast 2'home roasting machines.Without doubt, home roasting is a rewarding hobby that lets you getmore involved in the process of making coffee.There are many benefits to the home roaster over buying pre-roastedcoffee:Freshness. It allows you to roast the coffee exactly when you wantit;Cost. There is a cost saving when shipping green beans in bulkversus a number of smaller bags containing roasted coffee. Thereusually also a discount of 30-40% when buying green beans insteadof roasted (see below for potential loses for the home roaster);Allows the consumer to have a wider range of coffees available atany given time as green beans will store for a much longer timethan roasted coffee.However, there are also potential loses consider when home roasting:Burning the roast. If you burn the roast, you will probably end upwith something unusable that will be wasted;Shrinkage. Most people roasting at home do not take into accountthe shrinkage when roasting coffee. On average, depending on theroast style, around 15-20% of the starting weight is lost in chaffand moisture reduction. This means that allied with wear and tearon the roasting machine, it is not always a money saver to roast athome;Experimentation. To develop a roast profile for a coffee, aprofessional roaster will try out many different roast stylesbefore settling on the one to use. The home roaster may not havethis luxury, and consequently may not be able to enjoy the samestandard of coffee.On the whole, home roasting is very rewarding and many people viewit as an exciting hobby rather than a way of saving money overbuying roasted coffee.There are many coffee resources offering information about homeroasting, such as: www.toomuchcoffee.com www.coffeegeek.com www.homebarista.com www.homeroasters.orgIn the final instalment of Coffee101 tomorrow, we will have a lookat the 'Has Bean Ten Commandments' for great coffee.Grind per brew!

## Lesson 10

Time really flies and sadly this is the last of our little gettogethers, but before we finish up, there is still time for alittle more coffee fun.The aim of this lesson is to get you to think in a light heartedway about the basic principles of brewing coffee.  We could callthem guidelines or just some basic principles of brewing the verybest coffee possible, but these are the 'Has Bean Ten Commandments'for great coffee:1. Thou shalt know your machineWhether it is an expensive espresso machine or a simple Frenchpress, it is important to learn as much as you can about theparticular method that you are using. A good place to start isreading the instructions. Okay, you may already know how to use aFrench press (covered in lesson seven), but the instructions willlet you know exactly how it was intended to be utilised. Knowingthe 'ins and outs' of any brewing method can only make the finalproduct that little bit better.2. Thou shalt have basic machine hygieneEquipment hygiene is of vital importance. You can have thefreshest, highest quality beans from your favourite origin andfarm, but with a dirty brewer it will taste awful and not show thefinal drink at its best. It never ceases to surprise me whenvisiting some high volume coffee shops that we supply with beans,who have some of the finest espresso machines money can buy, justhow dirty they allow their machines to become. Do have a routinethat suits you, but always keep it clean at all costs.Something as simple as taking apart the mesh filter from a Frenchpress or cleaning the funnel on a moka pot can have huge benefitsto your brew. Professional cleaning products like Cafiza are widelyavailable and will help you keep your machine clean for areasonable price.3. Thou shalt grindThe biggest asset to fine coffee is a quality grinder. If you buynothing else, get a good burr grinder. Spending wisely at thisstage can save the need for an upgrade later (see lesson sevenabout coffee on a budget).Spending as much as you can afford on a grinder will reap itsrewards. "So should I buy pre-ground coffee?" people often ask, andthe simple answer is always "No" (see lesson eight). Without goinginto too much detail here, coffee when ground releases CO2. CO2acts as a delivery service for all those lovely unique tastes. Oncethe CO2 is released those great tastes are stranded without acourier to deliver them to your tongue.Grind just before brewing or as close to it as you can. When Ifirst became involved in coffee, I was once told as an experimentto grind coffee, and smell it straight away. Then after ten minutesreturn and smell again. In just ten minutes what was great coffeehad become good coffee. Just imagine what days and months can do toit.Practice with your grinder to find the perfect grind for you andyour machine. I have used many hundreds of kilos in the past'dialling-in' grinders, but not a gram of it was a  waste. Don't beafraid of short term pain for a long term gain. There are rewardsto be reaped.4. Thou shalt use quality waterAn underestimated factor in coffee brewing surprisingly is water(see lesson eight). Considering it makes up to 99% of the drink, Iam amazed that more attention isn't paid to it.Fresh water is a must. For some machines it is imperative itpasses through a softener, although in a recent experiment witha friend we discussed that overly soft water in some brewingmethods is a bad thing. Filtered water is a good idea and if yourmains water is particularly bad even bottled water can be usedproviding it contains the correct amount of calcium (this needs tobe low).5. Thou shalt use the correct water temperatureI feel a contentious issue coming on here. There are many schoolsof thought where water temperature is concerned, however, for thesake of this article, I am right and they are wrong! Water forbrewed coffee should be just off boiling at around 95-97ºC (and alittle cooler in espresso machines). Too hot and it will tastenasty and bitter, ("boil the bean, spoil the bean"), too cold andyou will not get a proper extraction, which is vital in the pursuitof the perfect cup.6. Thou shalt extract correctlyJust as important is the amount of time the water is exposed to theground coffee. Using a drip brewer this is not too much of aproblem, though making sure the grounds are evenly distributedhelps, but, for example, with an espresso or a vacuum pot, boy ohboy, is it important!I am not going to go into the ins and outs of each individualmethod and discuss them here, but it is crucial to make sure thatextractions are spot on. Once again, instructions will help youunderstand the perfect extraction time for your chosen method ofmaking coffee.7. Thou shalt Drink it freshIf I ever see a filter brewer with a hotplate, I am immediately 99%certain that the coffee is going to be bad. If I see my espressopulled and sitting on the side whilst the others are prepared,  Iam fairly sure that it is not going to be good. The simple messagehere is to drink coffee as soon as it is brewed. If you must keepcoffee made in, for instance, a filter or French press then puttingit in a vacuum flask is best. Never re-heat it and never keep itwarm on a hot plate.8. Thou shalt only drink speciality coffeeThink about it. Why would you drink anything less?9. Thou shalt think about the farmer and workers who produced yourcoffee, whilst you drink itCoffee people are passionate and proud of their profession. Farmerswork hard to produce the finest coffees possible for yourenjoyment. Rejoice in their knowledge and skill.10. Thou shalt enjoy your coffeeAlways, if you follow a few simple guidelines.So that is the end of the course. It is all finished.
